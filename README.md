Cyberoam can be a pain. Here is a set of my home remedies.

``cyberoam.py`` - Contains the basic login, logout features.

``bruteforece.py`` - Helps me find new usernames when I run out of bandwidth.

``cycle.py`` - This helps me login without caring. Uses different username/password combinations automatically on disconnection, which I would do manually otherwise.
